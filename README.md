# Homebrew Tap for Legacy Lua

Original formulae from [`homebrew-core`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/tree/master).
I just removed the `disabled` field to make the formulae installable again.

### Adding Tap

```
$ brew tap keonly/homebrew-legacy-lua
```

### Installing Lua 5.1
```
$ brew install keonly/legacy-lua/lua@5.1
```
